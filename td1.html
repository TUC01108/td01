    This is the last day before the first day.
    
    Here is something I wrote a few years ago (6/26/16):
    I observe nature and geometry as Buckminster Fuller
    I know physics as Albert Einstein
    I program as Dennis Ritchie & Ken Thompson
    I know theoretical computing as Alan Turing
    I know cosmology as Stephen Hawking
    I know mathematics and topology as Leonhard Euler
    I know success as Napoleon Hill
    I know patience as Mahatma Gandhi
    I know confidence as Jesus
    
    -------------------------
    This being over 6 years later I'd think there would be different people on that list, but mostly it remains
    the same. Maybe we gravitate towards certain minds regardless of time? The idea with this is that if there
    was a table I could sit at with them then we could have conversations about their specialty and absorb and learn
    from eachother. A sort of meditation exercise. That's something I should start doing again.
    
    Maybe I have a batter's box type area to stage people who should join or replace people at the table such as:
    Carl Gauss (mathematics), Nikola Tesla (inventor), tbd

    2 days left before starting work. Pretty excited.
    I've created a separate html file for technical details.
    Can still write technical in here naturally and parse out afterwards so I dont overthink.
    But want a place where my thoughts are easy to distinguish from stuff I'm logging for reference.
    
    ------------
    While considering how to best use my time it sidetracked me a bit into thinking about useful things I've
    read in the past and things worth re-reading. Which is a specific type of material that bears more and more
    fruit each time you spend time on something. I have a hunch this includes almost everything but gets reduced
    to what we favor. Instantly Stoicism came to mind. I know this was a fad trend type thing that probably already passed
    through silicon valley, but the material I read years ago has stuck in my mind like a bookmark more than a splinter.
    I think meditations by Marcus Aurelius is one I particularly enjoyed so I will read it again but from a different
    frame of reference. I want to devour useful books and distill them into lifelong pursuits. It's something I've
    sort of always had in mind, but being a bit older and having experienced a few more life things gives me a 
    perspective on things like success, happiness, hard-work that were more theoretical before. The tangibleness of
    things creates an authentic connection whether to different parts of one's self or others. Humans have an ear, eye, 
    and nose for whether someone is speaking from their butt or heart which may have started from a place of survival, and
    actually probably still exists for the same purpose. Although the stakes seem to be less drastic. So stoicism is a tree
    I will climb again and pick a book that has legs and then I thought about Napoleon Hill again. This may be entirely
    because my dad bought the Laws of Success books for me as a gift on my 14th birthday and they are something I was
    not happy to receive at first, but over time read and re-read to find any and all value they would release to me, OR 
    maybe it's because there's something more there? My conclusion a few years ago is that Napoleon Hill like many other
    success authors end up telling you all they know about success, which is the act of writing about success. The ultimate
    reveal being a sort of view from outside of the bubble when you were promised a seat right in the center of that sphere.
    This might be short sighted in and of itself. Maybe it's a self defense tactic for stopping short of the real value
    that's being provided. I really don't know. Another feeling you get after trying to wring this series out is a true 
    feeling of impermanence. Like success is an idea and everyone has a general or focused idea on what it means for them, but
    real success is discovering what you need after you get the things you thought you needed. Sort of like a game of musical
    chairs where you never quite win if all you are ever looking towards is the act of sitting in the correct chair.
    It's the searching for that chair, the people you play that game with, the lessons you learn, and the room or environment you
    are in that provides that feeling of success that we usually attribute to an act of getting something. The pure and 
    simple smelling the roses along the way. So is reading this series a total waste of time? Possibly? But I think Mr. Hill
    reveals this in his own ways too. With the ultimate act of treating others as you would want to be treated if you were in 
    their shoes. That's all any of us really need at the end of the day. Pure empathy. All of this sort of lives in a bubble of
    no other problems but the ones you create for yourself, which can be short sighted too. As some rich well off people 
    contemplating how lucky some people are to have problems thrust onto them instead of thrusting them onto one's self.
    We all live or die in a heaven or hell of our own construction. If you are constantly being let down then why do you 
    desire that feeling of being let down? It's you that is attracting it if it is constant. The book the active side of 
    infinity gets to the heart of this and I don't know whether to consider it a great fiction or something deeper that we
    as humans need to consume as fiction to not question things too deeply and unsettle ourselves out of a 9-5 or 
    whatever routine "works" for our situation. All of this is to say that I will re read Meditations and re read 
    The Laws of Success and report back after. I am looking for that bundle of books that I can rotate endlessly
    and learn and learn from.. There is a chance I find out one book only has so many lessons to reveal and the obvious 
    conclusion is to continue hopping from one to the next, but just like the idea of reading Code Complete once a year 
    to identify all the blind spots in my ability to design systems from the top most view to the details I want to do the 
    same for other areas of my life. Stoicism is for remaining impartial to adversity while being decisive, a good leader, 
    a great father and husband, and contributing to society in some way(s). the napoleon hill might just be a closing the door
    on an idea I buried at a young age to grow into a huge tree. Maybe it's giving success a new view that's needed.
    But reading is worthwhile and always better than scrolling through a social media account. I think time wasted is easy
    to identify. I really feel that sports and videogames are that for me. They can expand to take up way too much time.
    At least with working out in a gym I am doing something that should be healthy with fighting muscle atrophy and by increasing
    bone density, but that can be a waste too if you don't keep a close eye on it. Okay long ramble is almost done.
    I'll keep my eye on other books as we get closer to the new year, but depending on my work load I should be able to 
    get through most if not all of the ones listed:
    Meditations
    Code Complete
    The Laws of Success
    
    and I just realized what I really came here to say is the formula for selling these success books feels so gimicky.
    I wonder if it's just what was needed at the time it was written to shake unmotivated people out of their autopilot.
    Like it's introduced as Napoleon Hill did a bunch of digging to find something out by talking to all these successful people
    and then he found it and put it together ready for us if "we are ready." 
    I hear the same thing from Tony Robbins and maybe it says more about humans than the people sharing the message, because
    he says that by making his programs so expensive and still requiring people to prove they are ready to change and even then
    still not taking on every client that people actually hypnotize themselves into changing before theyve heard or read anything.
    Like we need to change ourselves or at least take down that barrier that's preventing us to change in order to actually
    absorb anything worthwhile someone else has to share. Which does make sense from my experience. You can say the same
    thing to two people and they hear or dont hear two completely different things. Why isn't the attitude of our self
    priming discussed more in middle and high school. They talk about attitude as if it's something we can change or need 
    to change without discussing any tools or methods to do so... makes you wonder. Okay that's all about that.
    -----
        so I may have an easier way to distill Hill's info with this episode format- https://www.hoopladigital.com/play/14970863/0
    (decide definitely) What do you want most in your entire lifetime?
    [write it down on paper to be read]
    
    Definiteness of Purpose
    1) Whatever the mind can conceive and believe the mind can achieve.
    
    The power to take possession of your own mind and direct it to whatever ends you may desire. 
    
    Procure a notebook.
    1) On page one write down a clear description of your major desire in life. Your idea of success.
    2) Page two write down a clear statement of precisely what you intend to give in return for that which you desire in life. and start giving now.
    3) memorize both statements and repeat them at least a dozen times daily. and always end with this expression of gratitude-
    Oh divine providence I ask not for more riches but more wisdom with which to accept and  make wiser use of the 
    riches you gave me at birth consisting in the power to control and direct my own mind to whatever ends I desire.
    
   ----
   and I just remembered that there was a Seneca book I really enjoyed as well. think it was Letters from a Stoic.
   
   there's an audiobook version of the Law of Success that I can listen to in the evenings.
   Think this will be a good way to go through it while keeping notes- https://www.hoopladigital.com/title/13401459
   ---
   
   and that concludes my morning side quest.

<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	Continuing with Code complete. I'm not sure if this is the correct best use of time as it's a large thing to take small bites out of,
	but it's something that I plan to continue taking bites out of until it's completely consumed and then to set it on a repeating timer to
	consume annually for next few decades. This resource should be something I get something new out of each time I read. If it's not then I wont
	treat it as such. This should be a part of xedwin or xthomas.. not sure which Im doing yet..
	
	xolava or xola is personal bank interface. idea is true decentralization of moving funds to and from also social implementation for 
	monetizing content and artwork and finding the blur between the two. Maybe figuring out when a photo on vacation turns into Art and how
	to transfer it and present it as such?
	
	I want to fork this repo for pure public thought transfer. Or create a new one.
	
	xyordana can be something specific that she wants to promote... this is tbd but xolava and xthomas are definite.
	
	Let's do a quick brain exercise for best way to use time before thursday.
	I am preparing for a Java Developer position that begins 9am 11/17/22. This is an HR day so not too worried skill-wise.
	
	When I mentioned that code complete should be a part of xthomas what I mean is that it will at the very least remind me when to read
	it again which is a countdown timer that begins each time I finish reading it.. maybe 182 days after I finish? maybe 365?
	And there should be about 3-4 other books in this basket as well that are strength tested and dropped if they dont hold up.
	Off the top of my head this book and a stoicism book like Meditations by Marcus Aurelius would be great. What else can expand my mind
	in a similar and dynamic way? I'd like to think a Buckminster Fuller book but they can be distracting and hard to gauge as progress fueling.
	Fuller books feel perfect for unlimited time version of my life, which would be granted through investing properly, but as a husband and a dad
	I no longer have an opportunitty for true unlimited time, which I think is a fair trade off.
	
	Going back to brain exercise what is the best way to use my time before Thursday? I have 6-8 hours today, Tuesday, and Wednesday, so
	18-24 hours. The benefit of continuing with code complete is the macro view it provides which as a Junior is something worth trying to
	grasp over and over until it suddenly and slowly becomes more clear. This is something that one of my bosses said is a goal for the first 60-90 days.
	I want to listen so well that people can hear/see/feel themselves being heard. My goals are to not have anyone repeat themselves unless absolutely
	necessary, ask questions in a very deliberate and focused way while showing example (when necessary) of what I tried before asking, map out who is
	who in the organization and how they connect with my position, provide as much value as quickly as possible, and update this every 3 months.
	
	Going back again what are other ways to best use my time? Other ways I have used my time is digging into some of my projects that touch the
	skills that this position will touch such as Java, Spring, Spring Boot, Angular, TypeScript, CSS, SQL, Postman, DBeaver, AWS, etc.
	It would be impossible to get all of them up to speed all the way, so my plan is to just have them fresh and ready to dive into the one that
	is most needed for the position that reveals itself. I've also read some ancedotes from people entering a job in similar situation and how
	to best provide value in that situation. The main advice seems to be ask questions, which makes me believe that this is more of a reaction
	type of situation vs a prepare and jam pack into small amount of time situation.
	
	I'll try again what are other ways to best use my time before work begins? I would say to find a stress-free way to best prepare.
	To open my mind and be well rested. There is very little I can do between now and then to upskill or become an uber programmer, so
	relaxation and preparation for a professional change. Things that really come to mind are my attitude, how I am perceived, if I can be curious
	and humble, how to be completely respectful yet defend myself if needed, my appearance, my formality and how casual to be, friendly yet serious,
	I just want to be the best teammate that I can be, I want to show traits of a leader with loyalty and empathy.
	
	All of this is to say that I feel ready for this position and want to journal daily or weekly or at minimum monthly.
	I want it to be a place that anyone feels comfortable reading my thoughts whether its a coworker or boss or family member or stranger.
	I hope that anyone in a similar situation gains something of value but mostly I want to spill out the thoughts in my head so they dont jumble 
	around too much and effect other thoughts. I want to keep learning and growing as an individual and being of value to my family and society.

    Adding git commands as a refresher-
    [refer to tdt1.html for this info]
    
    I know this sort of turned into technical talk about GIT and github but this is sort of how my brain works as
    things develop. If I need to parse this out to make it easier to read my thoughts vs what I'm putting for referance
    then I'll figure out as I go.
    
    this is how far I got- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes
    I think with git I'll keep reading but more so reference for when I need certain commands.
