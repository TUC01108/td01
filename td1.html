	Continuing with Code complete. I'm not sure if this is the correct best use of time as it's a large thing to take small bites out of,
	but it's something that I plan to continue taking bites out of until it's completely consumed and then to set it on a repeating timer to
	consume annually for next few decades. This resource should be something I get something new out of each time I read. If it's not then I wont
	treat it as such. This should be a part of xedwin or xthomas.. not sure which Im doing yet..
	
	xolava or xola is personal bank interface. idea is true decentralization of moving funds to and from also social implementation for 
	monetizing content and artwork and finding the blur between the two. Maybe figuring out when a photo on vacation turns into Art and how
	to transfer it and present it as such?
	
	I want to fork this repo for pure public thought transfer. Or create a new one.
	
	xyordana can be something specific that she wants to promote... this is tbd but xolava and xthomas are definite.
	
	Let's do a quick brain exercise for best way to use time before thursday.
	I am preparing for a Java Developer position that begins 9am 11/17/22. This is an HR day so not too worried skill-wise.
	
	When I mentioned that code complete should be a part of xthomas what I mean is that it will at the very least remind me when to read
	it again which is a countdown timer that begins each time I finish reading it.. maybe 182 days after I finish? maybe 365?
	And there should be about 3-4 other books in this basket as well that are strength tested and dropped if they dont hold up.
	Off the top of my head this book and a stoicism book like Meditations by Marcus Aurelius would be great. What else can expand my mind
	in a similar and dynamic way? I'd like to think a Buckminster Fuller book but they can be distracting and hard to gauge as progress fueling.
	Fuller books feel perfect for unlimited time version of my life, which would be granted through investing properly, but as a husband and a dad
	I no longer have an opportunitty for true unlimited time, which I think is a fair trade off.
	
	Going back to brain exercise what is the best way to use my time before Thursday? I have 6-8 hours today, Tuesday, and Wednesday, so
	18-24 hours. The benefit of continuing with code complete is the macro view it provides which as a Junior is something worth trying to
	grasp over and over until it suddenly and slowly becomes more clear. This is something that one of my bosses said is a goal for the first 60-90 days.
	I want to listen so well that people can hear/see/feel themselves being heard. My goals are to not have anyone repeat themselves unless absolutely
	necessary, ask questions in a very deliberate and focused way while showing example (when necessary) of what I tried before asking, map out who is
	who in the organization and how they connect with my position, provide as much value as quickly as possible, and update this every 3 months.
	
	Going back again what are other ways to best use my time? Other ways I have used my time is digging into some of my projects that touch the
	skills that this position will touch such as Java, Spring, Spring Boot, Angular, TypeScript, CSS, SQL, Postman, DBeaver, AWS, etc.
	It would be impossible to get all of them up to speed all the way, so my plan is to just have them fresh and ready to dive into the one that
	is most needed for the position that reveals itself. I've also read some ancedotes from people entering a job in similar situation and how
	to best provide value in that situation. The main advice seems to be ask questions, which makes me believe that this is more of a reaction
	type of situation vs a prepare and jam pack into small amount of time situation.
	
	I'll try again what are other ways to best use my time before work begins? I would say to find a stress-free way to best prepare.
	To open my mind and be well rested. There is very little I can do between now and then to upskill or become an uber programmer, so
	relaxation and preparation for a professional change. Things that really come to mind are my attitude, how I am perceived, if I can be curious
	and humble, how to be completely respectful yet defend myself if needed, my appearance, my formality and how casual to be, friendly yet serious,
	I just want to be the best teammate that I can be, I want to show traits of a leader with loyalty and empathy.
	
	All of this is to say that I feel ready for this position and want to journal daily or weekly or at minimum monthly.
	I want it to be a place that anyone feels comfortable reading my thoughts whether its a coworker or boss or family member or stranger.
	I hope that anyone in a similar situation gains something of value but mostly I want to spill out the thoughts in my head so they dont jumble 
	around too much and effect other thoughts. I want to keep learning and growing as an individual and being of value to my family and society.

        https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository
    Adding git commands as a refresher-
    go to the project directory
    type
        git init
    if adding existing files in directory to be tracked then type
        git add .
        git commit -m "first commit"
    if cloing an existing repository
        git clone <url>
            can also use git:// or ssh check here- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/ch00/_getting_git_on_a_server
    checking which files are in which state
        git status
    or (short hand) 
        git status -s
    ignoring files
        cat .gitignore
        *.[oa]
        *~
            # ignore all .a files
            *.a

            # but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
            !lib.a

            # only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
            /TODO

            # ignore all files in any directory named build
            build/

            # ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
            doc/*.txt

            # ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
            doc/**/*.pdf
    https://github.com/github/gitignore
    
    to find what you have changed but not yet staged? and what have you staged that you are about to commit?
        git diff
    can skip the staging area all together with
        git commit -a -m "commit you need"
    to remove a file
        git rm
    If you modified the file or had already added it to the staging area, you must force the removal with the 
    -f option. This is a safety feature to prevent accidental removal of data that hasn’t yet been recorded in 
    a snapshot and that can’t be recovered from Git.
    Another useful thing you may want to do is to keep the file in your working tree but remove it from your 
    staging area. In other words, you may want to keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it 
    anymore. This is particularly useful if you forgot to add something to your .gitignore file and 
    accidentally staged it, like a large log file or a bunch of .a compiled files.
        git rm --cached README
    If you want to rename a file
        git mv file_from file_to
    equivalent to changing file name and then removing previous file and adding new file
    
    if you want to view history
        git log
    if you want to view difference in each commit and limit entries
        git log -p -2
    type :q to exit scroll text
    
    can change the format of log output with pretty=
        git log --pretty=oneline
        git log --oneline
    limit by time
        git log --since=2.weeks
    You can also filter the list to commits that match some search criteria. The --author option allows you 
    to filter on a specific author, and the --grep option lets you search for keywords in the commit messages.    
    
    if you want to see which commits modifying test files in the Git source code history were committed by Junio 
    Hamano in the month of October 2008 and are not merge commits, you can run something like this:
        git log --pretty="%h - %s" --author='Junio C Hamano' --since="2008-10-01" \
        --before="2008-11-01" --no-merges -- t/
    
    Depending on the workflow used in your repository, it’s possible that a sizable percentage of the commits 
    in your log history are just merge commits, which typically aren’t very informative. To prevent the display 
    of merge commits cluttering up your log history, simply add the log option --no-merges.
    
    If you forgot a file you wanted to add
        git commit -m 'Initial commit'
        git add forgotten_file
        git commit --amend
    
    unstaging a staged file
        git reset HEAD <file>
    
    unmodifying a modified file
        git checkout -- <file>
    
    undoing things with git restore
        git restore
    
    so after creating a repo locally all I had to do to add to github is: 
        create new repo
        git remote add origin <.git address>
        git branch -M main
        git push -u origin main
    
    I know this sort of turned into technical talk about GIT and github but this is sort of how my brain works as
    things develop. If I need to parse this out to make it easier to read my thoughts vs what I'm putting for referance
    then I'll figure out as I go.

	There are two ways of constructing a software design: 
one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously
no deficiencies, and the 
other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
—C. A. R. Hoare

When I am working on a

I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it
