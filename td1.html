	Continuing with Code complete. I'm not sure if this is the correct best use of time as it's a large thing to take small bites out of,
	but it's something that I plan to continue taking bites out of until it's completely consumed and then to set it on a repeating timer to
	consume annually for next few decades. This resource should be something I get something new out of each time I read. If it's not then I wont
	treat it as such. This should be a part of xedwin or xthomas.. not sure which Im doing yet..
	
	xolava or xola is personal bank interface. idea is true decentralization of moving funds to and from also social implementation for 
	monetizing content and artwork and finding the blur between the two. Maybe figuring out when a photo on vacation turns into Art and how
	to transfer it and present it as such?
	
	I want to fork this repo for pure public thought transfer. Or create a new one.
	
	xyordana can be something specific that she wants to promote... this is tbd but xolava and xthomas are definite.
	
	Let's do a quick brain exercise for best way to use time before thursday.
	I am preparing for a Java Developer position that begins 9am 11/17/22. This is an HR day so not too worried skill-wise.
	
	When I mentioned that code complete should be a part of xthomas what I mean is that it will at the very least remind me when to read
	it again which is a countdown timer that begins each time I finish reading it.. maybe 182 days after I finish? maybe 365?
	And there should be about 3-4 other books in this basket as well that are strength tested and dropped if they dont hold up.
	Off the top of my head this book and a stoicism book like Meditations by Marcus Aurelius would be great. What else can expand my mind
	in a similar and dynamic way? I'd like to think a Buckminster Fuller book but they can be distracting and hard to gauge as progress fueling.
	Fuller books feel perfect for unlimited time version of my life, which would be granted through investing properly, but as a husband and a dad
	I no longer have an opportunitty for true unlimited time, which I think is a fair trade off.
	
	Going back to brain exercise what is the best way to use my time before Thursday? I have 6-8 hours today, Tuesday, and Wednesday, so
	18-24 hours. The benefit of continuing with code complete is the macro view it provides which as a Junior is something worth trying to
	grasp over and over until it suddenly and slowly becomes more clear. This is something that one of my bosses said is a goal for the first 60-90 days.
	I want to listen so well that people can hear/see/feel themselves being heard. My goals are to not have anyone repeat themselves unless absolutely
	necessary, ask questions in a very deliberate and focused way while showing example (when necessary) of what I tried before asking, map out who is
	who in the organization and how they connect with my position, provide as much value as quickly as possible, and update this every 3 months.
	
	Going back again what are other ways to best use my time? Other ways I have used my time is digging into some of my projects that touch the
	skills that this position will touch such as Java, Spring, Spring Boot, Angular, TypeScript, CSS, SQL, Postman, DBeaver, AWS, etc.
	It would be impossible to get all of them up to speed all the way, so my plan is to just have them fresh and ready to dive into the one that
	is most needed for the position that reveals itself. I've also read some ancedotes from people entering a job in similar situation and how
	to best provide value in that situation. The main advice seems to be ask questions, which makes me believe that this is more of a reaction
	type of situation vs a prepare and jam pack into small amount of time situation.
	
	I'll try again what are other ways to best use my time before work begins? I would say to find a stress-free way to best prepare.
	To open my mind and be well rested. There is very little I can do between now and then to upskill or become an uber programmer, so
	relaxation and preparation for a professional change. Things that really come to mind are my attitude, how I am perceived, if I can be curious
	and humble, how to be completely respectful yet defend myself if needed, my appearance, my formality and how casual to be, friendly yet serious,
	I just want to be the best teammate that I can be, I want to show traits of a leader with loyalty and empathy.
	
	All of this is to say that I feel ready for this position and want to journal daily or weekly or at minimum monthly.
	I want it to be a place that anyone feels comfortable reading my thoughts whether its a coworker or boss or family member or stranger.
	I hope that anyone in a similar situation gains something of value but mostly I want to spill out the thoughts in my head so they dont jumble 
	around too much and effect other thoughts. I want to keep learning and growing as an individual and being of value to my family and society.

    Adding git commands as a refresher-
    go to the project directory
    type
        git init
    if adding existing files in directory to be tracked then type
        git add .
        git commit -m "first commit"
    if cloing an existing repository
        git clone <url>
            can also use git:// or ssh check here- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/ch00/_getting_git_on_a_server
    checking which files are in which state
        git status

	There are two ways of constructing a software design: 
one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously
no deficiencies, and the 
other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
—C. A. R. Hoare

When I am working on a 
problem I never think about 
beauty. I think only how to 
solve the problem. But when 
I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it 
is wrong.
—R. Buckminster Fuller
