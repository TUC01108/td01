        https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository
    Adding git commands as a refresher-
    go to the project directory
    type
        git init
    if adding existing files in directory to be tracked then type
        git add .
        git commit -m "first commit"
    if cloing an existing repository
        git clone <url>
            can also use git:// or ssh check here- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/ch00/_getting_git_on_a_server
    checking which files are in which state
        git status
    or (short hand) 
        git status -s
    ignoring files
        cat .gitignore
        *.[oa]
        *~
            # ignore all .a files
            *.a

            # but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
            !lib.a

            # only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
            /TODO

            # ignore all files in any directory named build
            build/

            # ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
            doc/*.txt

            # ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
            doc/**/*.pdf
    https://github.com/github/gitignore
    
    to find what you have changed but not yet staged? and what have you staged that you are about to commit?
        git diff
    can skip the staging area all together with
        git commit -a -m "commit you need"
    to remove a file
        git rm
    If you modified the file or had already added it to the staging area, you must force the removal with the 
    -f option. This is a safety feature to prevent accidental removal of data that hasn’t yet been recorded in 
    a snapshot and that can’t be recovered from Git.
    Another useful thing you may want to do is to keep the file in your working tree but remove it from your 
    staging area. In other words, you may want to keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it 
    anymore. This is particularly useful if you forgot to add something to your .gitignore file and 
    accidentally staged it, like a large log file or a bunch of .a compiled files.
        git rm --cached README
    If you want to rename a file
        git mv file_from file_to
    equivalent to changing file name and then removing previous file and adding new file
    
    if you want to view history
        git log
    if you want to view difference in each commit and limit entries
        git log -p -2
    type :q to exit scroll text
    
    can change the format of log output with pretty=
        git log --pretty=oneline
        git log --oneline
    limit by time
        git log --since=2.weeks
    You can also filter the list to commits that match some search criteria. The --author option allows you 
    to filter on a specific author, and the --grep option lets you search for keywords in the commit messages.    
    
    if you want to see which commits modifying test files in the Git source code history were committed by Junio 
    Hamano in the month of October 2008 and are not merge commits, you can run something like this:
        git log --pretty="%h - %s" --author='Junio C Hamano' --since="2008-10-01" \
        --before="2008-11-01" --no-merges -- t/
    
    Depending on the workflow used in your repository, it’s possible that a sizable percentage of the commits 
    in your log history are just merge commits, which typically aren’t very informative. To prevent the display 
    of merge commits cluttering up your log history, simply add the log option --no-merges.
    
    If you forgot a file you wanted to add
        git commit -m 'Initial commit'
        git add forgotten_file
        git commit --amend
    
    unstaging a staged file
        git reset HEAD <file>
    
    unmodifying a modified file
        git checkout -- <file>
    
    undoing things with git restore
        git restore
    
    so after creating a repo locally all I had to do to add to github is: 
        create new repo
        git remote add origin <.git address>
        git branch -M main
        git push -u origin main
    
    I know this sort of turned into technical talk about GIT and github but this is sort of how my brain works as
    things develop. If I need to parse this out to make it easier to read my thoughts vs what I'm putting for referance
    then I'll figure out as I go.
    
    this is how far I got- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes
    I think with git I'll keep reading but more so reference for when I need certain commands.
